^ADV("109","2")
white mist seeping in from the north.  The walls extend upward for well over
^ADV("109","3")
100 feet.  Suspended from some unseen point far above you, an enormous
^ADV("109","4")
two-sided mirror is hanging parallel to and midway between the canyon walls. 
^ADV("109","5")
(The mirror is obviously provided for the use of the dwarves who, as you know,

the window would seem to indicate that someone has been here recently.

Room.  It appears to be a repository for the "Adventure" program.  Massive
^ADV("115","3")
torches far overhead bathe the room with smoky yellow light.  Scattered about
^ADV("115","4")
you can be seen a pile of bottles (all of them empty), a nursery of young
^ADV("115","5")
beanstalks murmuring quietly, a bed of oysters, a bundle of black rods with
^ADV("115","6")
rusty stars on their ends, and a collection of brass lanterns.
^ADV("115","7")
 
^ADV("115","8")
Off to one side a great many dwarves are sleeping on the floor, snoring loudly.
^ADV("115","9")
A sign nearby reads, "Do not disturb the dwarves!"  An immense mirror is

3/You're at fork in path.
^ADV("124","1")
The path forks here.  The left fork leads northeast.  A dull rumbling seems to
^ADV("124","2")
get louder in that direction.  The right fork leads southeast down a gentle
^ADV("124","3")
slope.  The main corridor enters from the west.

^ADV("125","1")
The walls are quite warm here.  From the north can be heard a steady roar, so
^ADV("125","2")
loud that the entire cave seems to be trembling.  Another passage leads south,
^ADV("125","3")
and a low crawl goes east.

21/You're at breath-taking view.
^ADV("126","1")
You are on the edge of a breath-taking view.  Far below you is an active 
^ADV("126","2")
volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging, cascading back
^ADV("126","3")
down into the depths.  The glowing rock fills the farthest reaches of the
^ADV("126","4")
cavern with a blood-red glare, giving everything an eerie, macabre appearance.
^ADV("126","5")
The air is filled with flickering sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone.
^ADV("126","6")
 
^ADV("126","7")
The walls are hot to the touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out
^ADV("126","8")
all other sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted
^ADV("126","9")
formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky light
^ADV("126","10")
into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a deep gorge, filled
^ADV("126","11")
with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to have been crafted by the
^ADV("126","12")
devil himself.
^ADV("126","13")
 
^ADV("126","14")
An immense river of fire crashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its
^ADV("126","15")
way through the gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left.
^ADV("126","16")
To the right, an immense geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously from a
^ADV("126","17")
barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake which bubbles ominously.  The
^ADV("126","18")
far right wall is aflame with an incandescence of its own, which lends an
^ADV("126","19")
additional infernal splendor to the already hellish scene.

commands of one or two words.  I should warn you that I look at only the first

five letters of each word, so you'll have to enter "NORTHEAST" as "NE" to

I know of places, actions, and things.  Most of my vocabulary describes places
^ADV("t","51","2")
and is used to move you there.  To move, try words like forest, building, down-
^ADV("t","51","3")
stream, enter, east, west, north, south, up, or down.  I know about a few
^ADV("t","51","4")
special objects, like a black rod hidden in the cave.  These objects can be
^ADV("t","51","5")
manipulated using some of the action words that I know.  Usually you will need
^ADV("t","51","6")
to give both the object and action words, in either order, but sometimes I can
^ADV("t","51","7")
infer the object from the verb alone.  Some objects also imply verbs--in
^ADV("t","51","8")
particular, "INVENTORY" implies "TAKE INVENTORY," for which I will give you a
^ADV("t","51","9")
list of what you're carrying.

^ADV("t","51","11")
The objects have side effects; for instance, the rod scares the bird.  Usually
^ADV("t","51","12")
people having trouble moving just need to try a few more words.  Most people
^ADV("t","51","13")
trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are attempting something beyond
^ADV("t","51","14")
their (or my!) capability and should try a completely different tack.  To speed
^ADV("t","51","15")
the game you can sometimes move long distances with a single word.  For example,
^ADV("t","51","16")
"BUILDING" usually gets you to the building from anywhere above ground except
^ADV("t","51","17")
when you are lost in the forest.  Also, note that cave passages turn a lot, and
^ADV("t","51","18")
that leaving a room to the north does not guarantee entering the next room from
^ADV("t","51","19")
the south.  Good luck!

The trees of the forest are large hardwood oak and maple, with an occasional

grove of pine or spruce.  There is quite a bit on undergrowth, largely birch and

ash saplings plus nondescript bushes of various sorts.  This time of year

If you want to end your adventure early, say "QUIT".  To suspend your adventure

so that you can continue later, say "SUSPEND" or "PAUSE" or "SAVE".  To see what

hours the cave is normally open, say "HOURS".  To see how well you're doing, say

"SCORE".  To get full credit for a treasure, you must have left it safely in the

building, though you get partial credit just for locating it.  You lose points
^ADV("t","142","6")
for getting killed or for quitting, though the former costs you more.  There

are also points based on how much (if any) of the cave you've managed to

explore; in particular, there is a large bonus just for getting in (to distin-

determine whether you've been through some of the more harrowing sections.

If you think you've found all the treasures, just keep exploring for a while.

If nothing interesting happens, you haven't found them all yet.  If something

to garner many more points in the master's section.

I may occasionally offer hints if you seem to be having trouble.  If I do, I'll
